## Setup

1. Copy example config files.
    - Navigate to the `config` folder of this project.
    - Copy all files ending in `.example.json` and remove the `.example` from the copied file names.
        - Ex: `config.example.json` should be copied and renamed as `config.json`.
2. Obtain a bot token.
    - You'll need to create a new bot in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
        - See [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) for detailed instructions.
        - At the end you should have a **bot token**.
3. Modify the config file.
    - Open the `config/config.json` file.
    - You'll need to edit the following values:
        - `client.id` - Your discord bot's [user ID](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials).
        - `client.token` - Your discord bot's token.
4. Install packages.
    - Navigate into the downloaded source files and type `npm install`.
    - Also run `pip install openai-whisper`
5. Register commands.
    - In order to use slash commands, they first [have to be registered](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/command-deployment.html).
    - Type `npm run commands:register` to register the bot's commands.
        - Run this script any time you change a command name, structure, or add/remove commands.
        - This is so Discord knows what your commands look like.
        - It may take up to an hour for command changes to appear.

## Start Scripts

You can run the bot in multiple modes:

1. Normal Mode
    - Type `npm start`.
    - Starts a single instance of the bot.
2. Manager Mode
    - Type `npm run start:manager`.
    - Starts a shard manager which will spawn multiple bot shards.
3. PM2 Mode
    - Type `npm run start:pm2`.
    - Similar to Manager Mode but uses [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to manage processes.
